made it with the command /chat instead of typing in a specific channel. Please follow it's README for install : you however do not need the channel ID anymore. You can also do pip3 install requirements.txt

Usage : /chat <query>
The first time you run the bot, you might want to run the commented line 33 : await tree.sync(). You can then remove this line if you restart the bot.
